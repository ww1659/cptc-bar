## Hello!

Welcome to this repo. This project is the first I have attempted with Next.js, using the in-built API routes for backend integration. 


## Getting Started

If you want to run this yourself, firstly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

And the open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Deployment Link

This project is currently deployed with Vercel. At the time of writing (10/04), there is no user Authentication, however this is due to be implemented. This link is primarily for development purposes so create orders and update the stock as you please!
